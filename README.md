Agile development was regarded as the most suitable approach for the study since it hinges on the core strength of constant and frequent iterations coming out on a regular basis as well as its ability to rapidly adapt to the ever-changing needs of both the project and the whims of the user. Given that, elaborated below are the various phases including their respective sub-processes employed throughout the study:
1.	Requirement Analysis<br>
The goals of a game of Tic Tac Toe can alter the specifications of the project.  applying the tic tac toe game's essential rules and strategy. Give users a straightforward graphical interface via which they can interact with the game. creating an algorithm to resolve ties and determine a game's winner. letting two players play the game in turn at the same time. 
2.	Design<br>
This was the second phase of the application, where the fundamental capabilities, organizational structure, specific goals, and key outcomes were all spelled down. To visually represent the app structure, they use mockup design and programs like Canva. Designing an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface is the main goal.
3.	Development<br>
This phase is highlighted by application construction, which entails building the real app while using automation technologies to translate process and data models into applications. A trustworthy user experience is achieved by ensuring compliance, implementing needed features, and conducting thorough testing.
4.	Testing<br>
The emphasis during this phase was on enhancing user value through enhanced system performance and quality. These tests are essential since they confirm that the system satisfies all requirements, ensuring its functionality and dependability.
5.	Deployment<br>
This phase should deal with the deployment of the application, which entails careful planning, carrying out the deployment process, and explaining how it functions to the user. This strategy guarantees a seamless transition and effective application implementation.
6.	Review/Maintenance<br>
The application was periodically examined to ensure that it met anticipated future requirements, the scope of any enhancements, functionality, and other functional additions.


# Sustainable Development Goals

Quality Education<br>

Since 2000, there has been enormous progress in achieving the target of universal primary education. The total enrollment rate in developing regions reached 91 percent in 2015, and the worldwide number of children out of school has dropped by almost half. There has also been a dramatic increase in literacy rates, and many more girls are in school than ever before. These are all remarkable successes.

Progress has also been tough in some developing regions due to high levels of poverty, armed conflicts and other emergencies. In Western Asia and North Africa, ongoing armed conflict has seen an increase in the number of children out of school. This is a worrying trend. While Sub-Saharan Africa made the greatest progress in primary school enrollment among all developing regions – from 52 percent in 1990, up to 78 percent in 2012 – large disparities still remain. Children from the poorest households are up to four times more likely to be out of school than those of the richest households. Disparities between rural and urban areas also remain high.

Achieving inclusive and quality education for all reaffirms the belief that education is one of the most powerful and proven vehicles for sustainable development. This goal ensures that all girls and boys complete free primary and secondary schooling by 2030. It also aims to provide equal access to affordable vocational training, to eliminate gender and wealth disparities, and achieve universal access to a quality higher education.
